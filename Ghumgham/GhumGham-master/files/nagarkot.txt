Nagarkot is the best spot to view the vicinity stretching from Dhaulagiri from the west to Kanchenjunga in the east. Situated on the top of the north-eastern ridge of Kathmandu valley at an altitude of around 2300 m, one can best view sunrise, sunset and Kathmandu valley. Just 32 km away from Kathmandu, it is also the best location for refreshment if we seek for the quieter place. Nagarkot is one of the best places in Nepal to visit in the both winter and summer season.
