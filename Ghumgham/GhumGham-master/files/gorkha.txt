Gorkha, other than the natural beauty that surrounds this place, is a place of historical importance. The Gorkha is the starting point of the unification of Nepal as a single kingdom by the then King Prithvi Narayan Shah. If you visit this place, it has beautiful palaces and temples. Also, since it is situated in the hilly part of Nepal, the scenery from here is unmatched. You can enjoy the scenery and understand the political history of Nepal. Be sure to visit Gorkha for its natural, historical, cultural and traditional beauty when you visit Nepal.
Nature is for everyone. There need not be any entry fee, be it for tourists or locals, to visit the natural beauty. Of course, there is an entry to places which need constant maintenance like a place of cultural importance, places that fall under world heritage sites and places of natural beauty like national parks. Other than that, there is never an entry fee to beautiful places in and around Kathmandu valley or around Nepal. If you walk around, every village and every corner, every hilltop is beautiful in Nepal. So, without even paying a penny, you can have a good experience in Nepal. Happy Travelling!
